# **Contextualizing the Water Watcher Project: Freshwater Health on the Colorado Plateau**

## **Stakeholders and Data Stewards in Regional Freshwater Health**

**Federal Agencies:** The Colorado Plateau’s water resources involve multiple U.S. agencies. The **U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)** operates stream gauges and water-quality stations, providing real-time flow data and chemistry measurements via the National Water Information System (NWIS) and special programs. For example, USGS leads integrated assessments of the Upper Colorado River Basin’s water availability, noting that the river system supports 40 million people, 5.5 million acres of irrigated land, 29 tribes, numerous wildlife refuges, recreation areas, and national parks[usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/regional-water-availability-assessment-upper-colorado-river#:~:text=The%20Colorado%20River%20and%20its,basin%20that). The **Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)** is another key steward; it sets water quality standards and hosts the Water Quality Exchange (WQX) and Portal. The EPA’s Water Quality Portal (WQP) aggregates data from over 400+ agencies (federal, state, tribal, local) into a national warehouse[waterqualitydata.us](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/#:~:text=The%20Water%20Quality%20Portal%20,Learn%20More). This cooperative data infrastructure means that federal and state monitoring results, along with tribal and local data (when shared), all feed into a common database. **Bureau of Reclamation (USBR)** manages water supply infrastructure (dams, reservoirs) critical to the Colorado River Basin and partners on studies (e.g. the *Ten Tribes Partnership Tribal Water Study*) to address water use and rights[usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/regional-water-availability-assessment-upper-colorado-river#:~:text=The%20Colorado%20River%20and%20its,basin%20that). Land management agencies like the **National Park Service (NPS)** and **U.S. Forest Service** also play a role by monitoring aquatic ecosystems on their lands. For instance, the NPS Southern and Northern Colorado Plateau monitoring networks regularly sample rivers in parks to detect issues (they found overall excellent water quality in 2019–2022, with 96.8% of measurements meeting standards, though concerns like high E. coli at certain sites and rising water temperatures were noted)[nps.gov](https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/ncpn-water-quality-report-2019-2022.htm#:~:text=,trespass%20livestock%20within%20the%20park)[nps.gov](https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/ncpn-water-quality-report-2019-2022.htm#:~:text=,expected%20to%20continue%20to%20rise). These federal stakeholders not only collect and steward data but also use it to make management decisions about water allocations, pollution controls, and ecosystem protection.

**State and Regional Entities:** Under the Clean Water Act framework, **state environmental agencies** are primary authorities for water quality standards and monitoring. Each Plateau state – Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona – has departments (e.g. state Departments of Environmental Quality or Water Resources) that conduct surface and groundwater monitoring and report impaired waters. They contribute data to EPA’s systems and manage state databases. For example, Colorado’s Water Quality Control Division and partners support the **Colorado Data Sharing Network (CDSN)**, a statewide data repository encompassing data from \~70 watershed groups, utilities, and others[watereducationcolorado.org](https://watereducationcolorado.org/publications-and-radio/headwaters-magazine/january-2018/sharing-water-quality-data/#:~:text=The%20Colorado%20Data%20Sharing%20Network,the%20Colorado%20Water%20Quality%20Control). After 15 years, the CDSN contained over 3.3 million water quality results from 11,000 stations, and it provides GIS maps and tools to overlay water-quality with land use, streamflow, and other datasets[watereducationcolorado.org](https://watereducationcolorado.org/publications-and-radio/headwaters-magazine/january-2018/sharing-water-quality-data/#:~:text=The%20Colorado%20Data%20Sharing%20Network,the%20Colorado%20Water%20Quality%20Control). This collaboration (coordinated by the Colorado Water Quality Monitoring Council) allows local volunteer data to meet state reporting requirements and be shared without reformatting[watereducationcolorado.org](https://watereducationcolorado.org/publications-and-radio/headwaters-magazine/january-2018/sharing-water-quality-data/#:~:text=All%20of%20that%20additional%20information,share%20or%20reformat%20those%20records). Similar initiatives exist in other states (e.g. Arizona’s **Water Watch** community science program and New Mexico’s **Water Data Initiative**). New Mexico notably passed a 2019 Water Data Act to integrate water quality, quantity, and usage data across state agencies into an open-access platform for better planning[waterdesk.org](https://waterdesk.org/resources/background/new-mexico-and-rio-grande/#:~:text=New%20Mexico%20Water%20Data). These efforts illustrate that states are both data stewards and end-users, needing robust, compatible systems to compile information for decision-making.

**Tribal Governments and Intertribal Organizations:** The Colorado Plateau includes many Indigenous nations (e.g. Navajo Nation, Hopi Tribe, Ute Mountain Ute, Havasupai, and others) with deep cultural and livelihood connections to freshwater. Tribes are crucial stakeholders in water health, with at least 29 federally recognized tribes relying on Colorado River basin waters[usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/regional-water-availability-assessment-upper-colorado-river#:~:text=The%20Colorado%20River%20and%20its,basin%20that). Many tribes have environmental departments or EPA-authorized programs to monitor water quality on their lands and set tribal water standards. However, historically tribal data has been underrepresented in national datasets – as of 2015, only about half of tribes eligible for federal CWA §106 monitoring funds were submitting data to EPA’s WQX, leaving “key gaps in the national water quality picture”[e-enterprisefortheenvironment.net](https://e-enterprisefortheenvironment.net/projects/tribal-water-quality-data-roadmap/#:~:text=The%20Challenge). To improve this, collaborative projects like the *Tribal Water Quality Data Roadmap* have emerged, offering guidance to help tribes collect and share data in the WQX/WQP system[e-enterprisefortheenvironment.net](https://e-enterprisefortheenvironment.net/projects/tribal-water-quality-data-roadmap/#:~:text=The%20guidance%20includes%20advice%20about,human%20health%20and%20the%20environment)[e-enterprisefortheenvironment.net](https://e-enterprisefortheenvironment.net/projects/tribal-water-quality-data-roadmap/#:~:text=In%202015%2C%20271%20Tribes%20were,the%20national%20water%20quality%20picture). Tribal coalitions such as the **Ten Tribes Partnership** focus on water rights and management in the Colorado River Basin, and the **Water & Tribes Initiative** advocates for greater tribal inclusion in basin governance. From a data stewardship perspective, tribes are asserting **Indigenous data sovereignty** – the right to control their own data and its use – which means tools like Water Watcher should involve tribes as partners, respect permissions, and highlight tribal water information where available. Tribal stakeholders will value data on water quality and quantity that supports community health (many communities face challenges like arsenic or uranium contamination in water), ecosystem restoration (protecting sacred springs and fisheries), and legal claims (quantifying water for settlements).

**Local Communities, NGOs, and Citizen Scientists:** A host of non-governmental organizations and local groups are active stewards of freshwater health. River and watershed alliances (e.g. *River Watch of Colorado*, *Friends of the San Juan*, *Grand Canyon Trust*, *Living Rivers*) engage in monitoring, restoration, and advocacy. For instance, River Watch of Colorado has enlisted volunteers for 32 years to collect water chemistry data statewide; these data have been *“instrumental in crafting informed water resources policy”* while also educating people about stream health in their backyards[coloradoriverwatch.org](https://coloradoriverwatch.org/data/#:~:text=River%20Watch%20collects%20a%20multitude,Palmeri%2C%20Sam%20Lewis%2C%20and%20Noah%C2%A0Goodkind). River Watch provides public visualization tools (interactive maps, trend graphs via an R Shiny app) for anyone to explore this volunteer-collected dataset[coloradoriverwatch.org](https://coloradoriverwatch.org/data/#:~:text=The%20StoryMap%20orients%20you%20to,forage%20your%20own%20relationship%20with)[coloradoriverwatch.org](https://coloradoriverwatch.org/data/#:~:text=The%20River%20Watch%20Data%20Tool,to%20generate%20these%20visuals%20and%C2%A0statistics). The program emphasizes open access: *“All River Watch data is publicly available… and delivered to \[state agencies\]… Without access to data, we cannot craft sound policy and empower communities to help protect what makes Colorado special — its beautiful rivers and streams”*[coloradoriverwatch.org](https://coloradoriverwatch.org/data/#:~:text=We%20are%20firm%20believers%20in,%E2%80%94%20its%20beautiful%20rivers%20and%C2%A0streams). This ethos of open data empowering the public is shared by many NGOs. Additionally, academic institutions and coalitions (like the Colorado Water Quality Monitoring Council, or New Mexico’s water data collaborative) act as conveners that develop tools, standards, and training for data collection. Overall, the stakeholder landscape for Plateau water health is a mosaic of federal and state agencies, tribal nations, and civic organizations. Each brings different data assets and needs – from high-precision USGS datasets to community observations – making collaboration and data sharing crucial.

## **User Groups: Needs and Use Cases for Water Data Tools**

A web-based “freshwater health explorer” like Water Watcher must serve a diverse user base. Key user groups and their needs include:

* **Environmental Planners and Resource Managers:** These professionals (in agencies, utilities, or consulting) require integrated data to guide decision-making and compliance. They need to **identify problem areas** (e.g. polluted streams, overdrawn aquifers) and track trends over time. For example, watershed planners working on a river restoration or a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) plan would use a tool to pinpoint where water quality standards are not met and investigate potential causes. They value the ability to overlay multiple layers – land use, discharge permits, habitat data – to get a holistic view. Access to historical data and statistics is critical: more complete datasets enable managers *“to tell a more rounded story with water quality data”*, contextualizing any single measurement with long-term context[watereducationcolorado.org](https://watereducationcolorado.org/publications-and-radio/headwaters-magazine/january-2018/sharing-water-quality-data/#:~:text=All%20of%20that%20additional%20information,of%20the%20Colorado%20Water%20Quality). Planners also need download/export functions for conducting their own analyses. In the Colorado Plateau’s context, an environmental planner might use Water Watcher to prioritize sites for remediation (for instance, identifying streams with high metal concentrations downstream of abandoned mines) or to simulate how a new development could impact watershed health. **Use case:** A city water manager in Arizona could consult the explorer to see if upstream E. coli levels are trending upward (indicating rising recreation or livestock impacts), then coordinate interventions.

* **Indigenous Communities and Tribal Water Managers:** For Native communities, water is not only a resource but also tied to sovereignty, culture, and public health. Tribal water managers need data to ensure **safe drinking water and healthy ecosystems** on their lands. This includes tracking contaminant levels (e.g. arsenic, uranium, bacteria) in wells and springs and monitoring river quality that affects fishing or farming. They may seek information upstream of their lands as well – for example, Navajo Nation managers monitoring the San Juan River want real-time alerts on upstream pollution events (as the Gold King Mine spill of 2015 painfully illustrated). At the same time, tribes often emphasize control over their data; they may prefer a system that lets them input and use data internally and decide what to share externally. A tool like Water Watcher could cater to tribal use by highlighting data near reservations, including tribal monitoring sites (with permission), and incorporating tribal water quality standards alongside state standards. **Use case:** An environmental technician for a tribe could use the explorer to compare water quality on tribal lands versus downstream state-monitored sites, helping identify any discrepancies or needs for further sampling. Additionally, Indigenous communities often have **cultural indicators** of water health (e.g. the presence of certain fish or plants). While these might not be in standard databases, a participatory platform could allow noting such observations. Inclusivity for this group also means interface accessibility (including support for multiple languages or offline access for remote areas), as well as recognition of tribal boundaries on maps. Ultimately, Indigenous users need tools that support both **technical water management and their sovereignty**, ensuring they are not simply “data providers” but equal partners in analysis and decision-making.

* **Outdoor Recreationists and the Public:** Outdoor enthusiasts (boaters, anglers, swimmers, hikers) and general citizens have growing interest in real-time water conditions and safety. Their needs revolve around **usability and immediate relevance.** A kayaker or rafter might check an explorer for current streamflow and water temperature to plan a trip, while an angler might look at aquatic life indicators or any pollution advisories (e.g. mercury in fish or harmful algal blooms). Recreation users want to know if water is clean enough for swimming or fishing – for instance, whether bacteria counts are within safe limits or if there have been any recent contamination events. They also care about the ecological health of waterways (e.g. are insect populations or native fish thriving?) as these affect the quality of recreation. Many recreation-based queries are location-specific (“Is **this** creek safe and flowing now?”), so a map-centric, mobile-friendly interface is essential. **Use case:** A family planning a camping and fishing weekend in Utah could use Water Watcher to zoom into their watershed, see if any streams are listed as impaired (perhaps for E. coli or heavy metals), check recent water-quality measurements, and even view any park service warnings. They could also discover restoration efforts in the area, which might encourage volunteerism or at least a better understanding of human impacts. For this group, simplicity and clarity are key – technical jargon should be minimized or well-explained. Including visual cues (like color-coded water quality ratings or icons indicating “swimmable/fishable” status) can help non-experts quickly grasp conditions. In short, recreationists and general citizens use a water health explorer as a “one-stop shop” for **discovering the condition of their local waters**, much like EPA’s How’s My Waterway tool was explicitly designed to do[epa.gov](https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/hows-my-waterway#:~:text=How%27s%20My%20Waterway%20was%20designed,Waterway%2C%20view%20our%20%2040). They appreciate when complex data is translated into answers to everyday questions (can I swim? eat the fish? is the river level too low or high?).

* **Educators and Students:** Teachers, professors, and informal educators (at nature centers, etc.) can leverage Water Watcher to promote environmental literacy. Their needs center on **accessible, engaging information** that can be incorporated into lessons or student projects. Educators often seek real-world datasets for students to analyze, interactive maps to explore geography and science concepts, and storytelling features to connect data with human and ecological narratives. For example, a middle school science teacher might use a lesson plan based on EPA’s How’s My Waterway[epa.gov](https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/hows-my-waterway-middle-school-lesson-plan#:~:text=How%27s%20My%20Waterway%20Middle%20School,and%20visualize%20water%20quality%20data), guiding students to investigate their watershed’s health and think critically about pollution sources. Water Watcher could provide similar value by allowing students to, say, compare water quality between two rivers, see trends over time (graphs of improving or declining metrics), and understand how water issues intersect with climate and land use. An important use case is **place-based education**: on the Colorado Plateau, an educator could have students examine why a certain stream in their county is impaired (perhaps due to mine runoff or agricultural return flows), spurring discussion on geology, chemistry, and social responsibility. Educators benefit from any “prepared” resources in the tool – such as an *education mode* with simpler explanations of parameters, or case studies highlighting success stories of water improvements. Additionally, since many schools serve Indigenous or rural communities in this region, culturally relevant data (like conditions on tribal lands or historical data during significant events) can enrich the learning experience. Overall, this group needs the explorer to be reliable, easy to navigate, and capable of generating maps/graphs that can be shared in classrooms. They also appreciate multilingual support (for English Language Learners) and compliance with accessibility standards so that all students can participate.

* **Scientists and NGOs (Power Users):** Beyond the general planners and citizens, there is a cohort of power users – academic researchers, nonprofit analysts, watershed group leaders – who might use Water Watcher as a starting point for deeper investigations. Their needs overlap with planners in requiring **high-quality data and analytical capability**, but they may push the tool further, for example by downloading large datasets or combining Water Watcher outputs with other software. A researcher might use the platform to identify data gaps for a study (e.g. noticing that very few water-quality samples exist for a certain tributary) or to quickly visualize correlations (does higher development correspond to higher nutrient concentrations?). NGOs focused on advocacy might use mapped outputs from Water Watcher in reports or grant proposals to illustrate problems. These users will value transparency (documentation of data sources, timestamps, methods) and perhaps **API access** or open data downloads to integrate Water Watcher’s data with their own models. While they likely have alternative advanced tools at their disposal, having a region-focused explorer saves time by aggregating relevant data in one interface. **Use case:** An environmental NGO staffer could use Water Watcher to generate a map of streams on the Navajo Nation with available pH and metal data, overlay mine locations, and identify which areas lack monitoring – information they could use to advocate for increased sampling or remediation funds. In serving this group, Water Watcher should not oversimplify to the point of hiding important details; instead, it might offer layered complexity (simple view vs. expert view) so that casual users aren’t overwhelmed but experts can drill down.

## **Existing Tools and Platforms for Freshwater Data Mapping**

There are several existing web-based tools that provide data and mapping of water conditions, which offer valuable lessons for Water Watcher. Key examples include:

* **EPA’s Freshwater Explorer 2.0:** A recently updated interactive mapping tool, Freshwater Explorer visualizes water quality parameters for streams, lakes, and groundwater wells nationwide[epa.gov](https://www.epa.gov/water-research/freshwater-explorer#:~:text=EPA%27s%20Freshwater%20Explorer%20is%20an,natural%20and%20human%20geographical%20factors). It draws on the massive Water Quality Portal database (hundreds of millions of records from over 500 partner organizations)[epa.gov](https://www.epa.gov/water-research/freshwater-explorer#:~:text=Water%20Quality%20Portal%20,WQX) and even estimates natural “background” water chemistry to flag where human activities might be impacting quality[epa.gov](https://www.epa.gov/water-research/freshwater-explorer#:~:text=quality%20parameters%20of%20freshwater%20streams%2C,natural%20and%20human%20geographical%20factors). Users can layer additional geographic data (from EPA and the GeoPlatform) and perform searches or data downloads[epa.gov](https://www.epa.gov/water-research/freshwater-explorer#:~:text=Users%20can%20now%20perform%20complex,42and%20LakeCat). **Features:** nationwide coverage; 11 key water parameters (nutrients, pH, metals, etc.); ability to compare observed vs. natural levels; data export and layer customization; mobile-friendly design[epa.gov](https://www.epa.gov/water-research/freshwater-explorer#:~:text=Compatibility%20and%20Availability). **Use and Users:** EPA designed it for a broad audience – *“citizens and non-governmental organizations”* can explore local and national water issues, while it also supports *“federal, state, Tribal, and local partners \[in\] making decisions”* about resources[epa.gov](https://www.epa.gov/water-research/freshwater-explorer#:~:text=be%20used%20by%C2%A0citizens%20and%20non,spatial%20layers%20to%20explore%20associations). **Strengths:** Comprehensive data integration and standardized summaries, which help users see big-picture patterns (e.g. where phosphorus or salinity issues are clustered) without being overwhelmed by raw data. It effectively cleans and harmonizes data from many sources, a big technical win[epa.gov](https://www.epa.gov/water-research/freshwater-explorer#:~:text=Freshwater%20Explorer%202.0%2C%20the%20clean,response%20relationships%20or%20evidence). **Limitations:** Because it’s national in scope, it may not provide the fine-grained context or most up-to-date local knowledge for the Colorado Plateau specifically. It relies on data submitted to national systems, meaning if a state or tribe’s data isn’t shared, it won’t appear. EPA notes that *more recent or detailed information may exist that isn’t yet in EPA’s databases*[epa.gov](https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/hows-my-waterway#:~:text=How%27s%20My%20Waterway%20was%20designed,Waterway%2C%20view%20our%20%2040), highlighting a lag between local data collection and federal availability. Additionally, Freshwater Explorer (built on ArcGIS) might be bandwidth-intensive for users with slow internet, and its interface, while powerful, could be daunting for non-experts without guidance (hence EPA provides a Quick Guide and glossary[epa.gov](https://www.epa.gov/water-research/freshwater-explorer#:~:text=Learn%20How%20to%20Use%20Freshwater,0)).

* **EPA’s How’s My Waterway:** This is a public-oriented web tool and app aimed squarely at the **general public and community leaders**. It allows users to input a location (address, ZIP, watershed, or even select a tribal area) and then delivers a snapshot of local waterway health. **Features:** It operates on three scales – Community, State, National – providing different levels of detail[epa.govepa.gov](https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/hows-my-waterway#:~:text=). At the community level, it shows which streams and lakes are nearby and whether they meet water quality standards for swimming, aquatic life, fish consumption, etc. It lists any *“identified issues (impairments and discharge violations)”*, info on monitored conditions, and even local drinking water source details[epa.gov](https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/hows-my-waterway#:~:text=). State and national tabs roll up broader metrics (like overall percentages of waters impaired, state program info, and key challenges). **Strengths:** Simplicity and context. How’s My Waterway was *“designed to provide the general public with information about the condition of their local waters”* in an easy-to-use format[epa.gov](https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/hows-my-waterway#:~:text=How%27s%20My%20Waterway%20was%20designed,Waterway%2C%20view%20our%20%2040). It integrates multiple EPA data sources: the latest state-reported assessments (303(d)/305(b) lists), permitted discharger data (from EPA’s ECHO database), fish advisories, and the Water Quality Portal for monitoring data. This means a user sees both regulatory status (is the waterbody impaired?) and actual sample data if available. The tool also excels in accessibility: it’s available in multiple languages (Spanish and others)[epa.gov](https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/hows-my-waterway#:~:text=,Assist%C3%AAncia) and even offers an embeddable widget for outreach. **Limitations:** How’s My Waterway doesn’t offer custom analysis or raw data download – it’s more of a dashboard. It might not include un-vetted data (like volunteer monitoring results that aren’t in state reports), and it updates according to EPA’s reporting cycles, which could miss rapidly developing issues. For a region-specific explorer like Water Watcher, HMW underscores the importance of framing data in understandable terms (like “Is it safe to swim here?”) and combining data with interpretive text. However, Water Watcher could go further by offering interactive analysis that HMW lacks.

* **USGS National Water Dashboard (NWD) & NWIS Mapper:** The USGS provides web tools focusing on **real-time conditions**. The National Water Dashboard is a map-based interface showing up-to-the-minute readings from 13,500+ stations (streamflow, groundwater levels, precipitation, water temperature, etc.)[usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/colorado-water-science-center/tools#:~:text=,NWD)[usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/colorado-water-science-center/tools#:~:text=The%20National%20Water%20Dashboard%20,observation%20stations%20across%20the%20country). Users can click on gages to see hydrographs and flooding thresholds. The NWIS Mapper allows discovery of any monitoring site (current or historical) in the USGS database and links to its data. **Strengths:** These tools are excellent for water quantity information – for example, seeing if a river is running high or low compared to normal is straightforward. They are mobile-friendly and widely used by resource managers and recreationists for quick checks. **Limitations:** They focus on USGS-collected data only, which for water quality means mainly continuous sensors (like water temperature, specific conductance, turbidity) and limited chemical sampling. They generally do **not** include the myriad of water quality samples that state agencies or others collect (those reside in the Water Quality Portal). So while a user could find, say, real-time turbidity on the San Juan River, they would not see periodic lab results for metals or nutrients via USGS tools alone. Also, these tools don’t integrate contextual layers or offer analysis beyond the graphing of time series. For Water Watcher, the lesson is that a truly comprehensive explorer might need to blend **USGS real-time feeds with broader water quality datasets** – few existing tools do both. Ensuring that the latest sensor readings (streamflow, etc.) appear alongside sample-based assessments would set Water Watcher apart.

* **State and Local Data Portals:** Each Plateau state has some public-facing tools. For instance, **Colorado’s Data Sharing Network** (mentioned above) provides an online mapping interface where users can view monitoring locations and overlay various GIS layers[watereducationcolorado.org](https://watereducationcolorado.org/publications-and-radio/headwaters-magazine/january-2018/sharing-water-quality-data/#:~:text=reaches,Environmental%20Protection%20Agency). It also offers basic statistical and graphing tools for the data contributed. **Arizona’s Water Watch** program has an ArcGIS Hub site for open data, where volunteers and ADEQ scientists upload observations (e.g. wet/dry stream mapping, water quality measurements) that anyone can view on a map. **Utah and New Mexico** have state water quality web maps showing assessed waters and monitoring stations (often as part of their environmental department websites). **Strengths:** These are tailored to local context and often include data from smaller streams or community projects that might not make it into federal databases promptly. They sometimes provide specialized views; for example, a state might highlight where lakes have harmful algal bloom warnings or show the status of water quality improvement projects. **Limitations:** They tend to be siloed by state – not ideal for a region like the Colorado Plateau that spans four states and many jurisdictions. Users would have to hop between a Colorado map and an Arizona map to follow a river that crosses the border. Additionally, the usability varies; some are simple but lack detailed data, while others are data-rich but not user-friendly for non-technical audiences. Compatibility issues can arise too: *“state and federal databases may not be compatible with each other, making it difficult to compile or synthesize records,”* as observed in Colorado’s experience[watereducationcolorado.org](https://watereducationcolorado.org/publications-and-radio/headwaters-magazine/january-2018/sharing-water-quality-data/#:~:text=Network%20partners%20have%20also%20become,Government%20Data%20Advisory%20Board%20tackles). This hints that a regional tool like Water Watcher could add value by **bridging across state lines and data systems** – something existing state portals don’t inherently do.

* **The Water Quality Portal (WQP) Interface:** Although not a glossy map, it’s worth noting the WQP’s own web interface as an “existing tool.” The WQP is described as *“the premiere source of discrete water-quality data in the United States”*, integrating data from USGS, EPA, and over 400 partner organizations[waterqualitydata.us](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/#:~:text=The%20Water%20Quality%20Portal%20,Learn%20More). The portal’s website allows users to query by geography, time, and parameter and download datasets (it even has an API for programmatic access). **Strengths:** Unmatched in data breadth – if data exist and have been shared, you can get it. It’s an open data backbone behind many other tools (Freshwater Explorer and How’s My Waterway both pull from it). **Limitations:** The interface is utilitarian and geared toward experienced users. It doesn’t generate visualizations itself; one must download and then graph or map data elsewhere. For most casual users, WQP is too technical, which is why higher-level explorers are built on top of it. The WQP also faces challenges of data lag and completeness (reliant on contributors submitting data in standardized form) and can suffer performance issues given its size[waterqualitydata.us](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/#:~:text=This%20site%20is%20experiencing%20performance,personnel%20will%20address%20when%20able). The takeaway for Water Watcher is that leveraging WQP data is wise (to avoid reinventing the wheel on data collection), but it should be packaged in a far more accessible and interactive format to truly serve the intended audience of planners, communities, and others.

* **Specialized Regional Tools:** There have been some one-off or specialized mapping tools focusing on aspects of Colorado Plateau water. For example, the **DOI’s Colorado River Basin Drought Visualization** (an interactive site launched in 2015\) used open data to show the 16-year drought’s effects on reservoir levels and flows[doi.gov](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-launches-new-interactive-web-tool-show-effects-16-year-drought-colorado-river#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%93%20On%20the%20heels,about%2050%20percent%20of%20capacity)[doi.gov](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-launches-new-interactive-web-tool-show-effects-16-year-drought-colorado-river#:~:text=of%20sources%20affiliated%20with%20the,Geological%20Survey). It linked multiple datasets (reservoir storage, precipitation, demand) to illustrate the system’s complexity, aiming to help stakeholders devise responses to the drought[doi.gov](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-launches-new-interactive-web-tool-show-effects-16-year-drought-colorado-river#:~:text=Launched%20as%20part%20of%20a,Geological%20Survey)[doi.gov](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-launches-new-interactive-web-tool-show-effects-16-year-drought-colorado-river#:~:text=technology%20at%20yesterday%E2%80%99s%20Roundtable,%E2%80%9D). Another example is the **USGS Science Portal for the Colorado River Basin** (launched 2024), which seeks to bring together **“science, data, and mapping and analytical tools from across the basin in a central location”** for resource managers dealing with long-term drought[usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/colorado-water-science-center/tools#:~:text=,for%20the%20Colorado%20River%20Basin)[usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/colorado-water-science-center/tools#:~:text=To%20help%20resource%20managers%20plan,basin%20in%20a%20central%20location). These indicate a move toward integrative platforms. Additionally, USGS’s **“Legacy Mine Lands Watershed Tool (WaDeS)”** focused on central Colorado, combining USGS and EPA water chemistry data to identify streams at risk from mine pollution and prioritizing sites for remediation[usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/colorado-water-science-center/tools#:~:text=,WaDeS). Such targeted tools underscore needs that generic ones haven’t fully met – in this case, the need to synthesize data to drive restoration decisions. **Strengths:** They demonstrate how open data can be combined creatively to address specific questions (drought resilience, mine impacts). They also often present data in narrative or story-map formats that resonate with policy makers. **Limitations:** Many are *ad hoc* (grant-funded prototypes or agency demos) rather than maintained operational tools. Thus, they may not stay updated or widely promoted once the initial push is over. Water Watcher can learn from these by incorporating their successful features (e.g. scenario visualizations, integrative stories) into a sustained platform that continues to evolve.

In summary, existing tools cover parts of the functionality spectrum – from broad national water quality mapping (EPA) to real-time hydrology (USGS) to state-specific data portals and niche analyses. Yet none specifically focus on the Colorado Plateau as a region, and each has limitations in either usability, scope, or currency that Water Watcher could strive to overcome.

## **Gaps and Unmet Needs that Water Watcher Could Address**

Despite the array of data tools available, several gaps persist in serving both expert and community needs on the Colorado Plateau. Water Watcher has an opportunity to fill these gaps in the following ways:

* **Cross-Boundary Integration:** One clear need is for a *regionally focused* platform that isn’t confined by political boundaries. The Plateau’s watersheds ignore state lines, and many tribal lands span multiple states. Currently, a user interested in the San Juan River, for example, might have to consult New Mexico’s and Utah’s databases separately to get the full picture. Water Watcher can aggregate data across the four states (CO, UT, AZ, NM) and tribal jurisdictions, presenting a seamless view of the region’s freshwater health. This could involve federating queries to multiple sources (state databases, WQP, USGS) and then harmonizing the results for the user. Technically, this addresses compatibility issues noted between databases[watereducationcolorado.org](https://watereducationcolorado.org/publications-and-radio/headwaters-magazine/january-2018/sharing-water-quality-data/#:~:text=Network%20partners%20have%20also%20become,Government%20Data%20Advisory%20Board%20tackles). Politically, it demonstrates a commitment to *collaboration* – showing state agencies and tribes side by side on equal footing. By being region-specific, Water Watcher can also include datasets unique to the Plateau (for instance, the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control measurements, or Grand Canyon spring ecology data) that national tools might overlook.

* **Timeliness and Dynamic Data:** A gap in many current tools is the divide between **real-time data** and **historical data**. Water Watcher could bridge that by incorporating live sensor feeds (streamflow, reservoir levels, perhaps water quality sondes) along with discrete sample data. This provides a more dynamic experience – users could see current conditions (e.g. river is flowing at 500 cfs and 10°C today) in context of the long-term health metrics (e.g. this river’s nutrient levels over the past decade). Additionally, by tapping into up-to-date sources (like USGS telemetry or state continuous monitoring networks), Water Watcher can reduce the lag between data collection and public availability. If designed with open data architecture, it might even allow **streaming data or alerts** (for example, sending a notification when turbidity spikes on a river, which might indicate a runoff event or spill). The inclusion of timely data will particularly benefit planners (for emergency response) and recreationists (for trip planning). It also encourages agencies to share data more rapidly. If Water Watcher highlights data gaps in near-real-time, it can spur improvements – e.g. showing that a major tributary has no current monitoring might prompt new sensors or sampling efforts.

* **User-Centric Usability:** While many existing platforms have rich data, they often require a steep learning curve. Water Watcher should prioritize a **user-friendly interface** that caters to multiple skill levels. This includes intuitive navigation (perhaps guided by typical questions like “What is the water quality near me?” or “Compare two sites…”), clear visuals (maps that use color coding for water quality index or icons for warnings), and explanations in plain language. It could borrow the tiered approach of How’s My Waterway (simple summary views with the option to drill down into technical details). Additionally, Water Watcher could improve on usability by allowing custom queries through a more natural interface – e.g. a user could draw a circle on the map and retrieve all data within it, or click on a river segment to see upstream sources. Another aspect is **mobile optimization**: many rural and Indigenous community members access internet primarily via smartphones, so a responsive mobile design (or even an offline-capable app) would increase accessibility. Compared to current tools, which may be desktop-centric or arcane, this focus on UX is an unmet need. For example, the Colorado Data Sharing Network has a wealth of information but requires understanding GIS layers and data codes that a layperson might not have; Water Watcher can layer on interpretive info (like labeling a parameter “Arsenic – drinking water standard: 10 µg/L” rather than just “As” and a value). In short, the gap is not data per se but *translating data into usable knowledge*, and that’s where thoughtful design is needed.

* **Incorporating Local and Indigenous Knowledge:** Beyond the quantitative datasets, Water Watcher could fill a participatory gap by allowing stakeholders to add context or qualitative information. This might be as simple as a comment or annotation system linked to a location (for instance, a Navajo rancher might annotate a spring that has run dry, or a volunteer might note an algal bloom observed on a certain date). Existing federal tools don’t accommodate user-generated input, yet such input can be crucial, especially in a region where official monitoring is sparse in remote areas. Including community-collected data (with appropriate vetting or flagging) can both fill data gaps and empower those communities. As noted, many Plateau areas are under-monitored – citizen science programs (like River Watch, Arizona Water Watch) help, but their findings need to be integrated and visible. Water Watcher could partner with these programs so that their results appear on the map in near real-time (with filters to toggle volunteer data on/off). This addresses an equity issue: *who collects data and whose data counts.* Currently, if data is not collected by an agency or shared to a portal, it effectively “doesn’t exist” for decision-making. By building a place for community observations, Water Watcher ensures that **voices on the ground are reflected**. Furthermore, through such participatory features, the tool becomes a two-way street – not just delivering information but also gathering local insights that agencies might otherwise miss.

* **Holistic “Freshwater Health” Indicators:** Many existing tools focus on either water quality chemistry or water quantity. However, **freshwater ecosystem health** is broader – it includes biological indicators (fish populations, macroinvertebrate indices), physical habitat, flow regime, and even social outcomes. Water Watcher could innovate by incorporating some holistic health indices. For example, some states calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for streams based on aquatic insect surveys – if such data exist for Plateau streams (perhaps from state bioassessment programs or NPS research), it could be displayed to give users a sense of biological health, not just chemical. Similarly, Water Watcher might include data on habitat connectivity or flow alteration (maybe using metrics from the Nature Conservancy or academia). While it may not be feasible to create a comprehensive new index right away, even pulling together disparate indicators in one place would be a step forward. The gap here is that a planner or advocate currently has to manually synthesize information: one source for water chemistry, another for endangered fish presence, another for flow statistics. Water Watcher can save effort by doing that integration. Addressing this gap has technical challenges (data formats vary, and some data like species occurrences may not be as readily accessible as water chemistry), but even a partial inclusion of ecological data would set Water Watcher apart and align with its “freshwater health” mandate in a more ecological sense.

* **Policy and Decision-Support Tools:** Another unmet need is translating data into **policy-relevant insights**. Agencies must make decisions like where to invest in water treatment upgrades, which stream segments to prioritize for protection, or how to negotiate water sharing under scarcity. Water Watcher could include decision-support modules or scenario analysis features. For example, it might model simple “what-if” scenarios (e.g. “if temperature rises 2°C, how many more days will stream X exceed thermal standards for trout?” or “if a certain pollutant input is reduced by 50%, does the river meet standards?”). Existing public tools generally stop at presenting current/historical data and don’t venture into forecasting or scenario planning except in standalone studies. Filling this gap could greatly enhance planning: an environmental planner could use Water Watcher to test management options virtually before implementing them. On the policy side, Water Watcher can highlight **gaps that need policy attention** – for instance, if it visualizes that certain tribal waters have no data, that implicitly calls for funding monitoring there; or if certain pollutants are consistently high region-wide, that flags the need for regional policy coordination. By providing region-specific insights (like ranking sub-watersheds by overall health or risk), Water Watcher can inform initiatives such as state water quality improvement strategies, tribal water resource assessments, or multi-state agreements. In doing so, it fills the gap between raw data and actionable knowledge for policymakers.

In summary, Water Watcher’s niche is to be **grounded, user-friendly, and regionally tailored**, addressing gaps left by larger but less focused tools. By integrating across boundaries, updating data frequently, prioritizing user needs, including community contributions, and framing information in a decision-making context, Water Watcher could significantly enhance how freshwater data is used on the Colorado Plateau. These gaps are not just technical; they are also gaps in engagement and relevance – closing them would mean a tool that truly meets users “where they are,” whether that’s a tribal water office, a local watershed group, or a government planning meeting.

## **Justice, Ecological, and Participatory Dimensions**

A truly impactful Water Watcher project must consider questions of justice, inclusion, and the broader consequences of data – who benefits from water data and who might be left out. Several important dimensions include:

* **Environmental Justice and Equity:** On the Colorado Plateau, as elsewhere, water challenges often hit marginalized communities hardest. Many Indigenous communities and small rural towns have faced contaminated water or lack of infrastructure (for example, decades of uranium mining left lasting water pollution on Navajo lands, and some remote communities still haul water for household use). Data justice means ensuring these issues are visible and addressed. Water Watcher can contribute by shedding light on water quality in underserved areas – rather than those areas being “blank spots” due to scarce data. If certain watersheds have little to no monitoring (often true for low-income or tribal regions), Water Watcher can highlight that absence, effectively giving voice to the need for attention. Moreover, by including data from tribal sources or community monitoring, it validates those experiences. A lack of data can itself be an injustice if it leads to problems being ignored. Conversely, providing robust data access to affected communities empowers them to advocate for solutions. As one citizen science program noted, access to data helps *“empower communities to help protect what makes \[their home\] special”*[coloradoriverwatch.org](https://coloradoriverwatch.org/data/#:~:text=We%20are%20firm%20believers%20in,%E2%80%94%20its%20beautiful%20rivers%20and%C2%A0streams). For Water Watcher, this could mean prioritizing an **inclusive dataset** (actively seeking tribal input, older studies, etc.) and presenting information in a culturally respectful way. It might also mean designing the tool to support community action – e.g. easy ways to download a report or infographic that a community group can use in meetings or grant applications.

* **Who Is Empowered vs. Excluded:** Historically, water data collection and usage have been dominated by government scientists and policy-makers. That is changing with open data and citizen science, but power imbalances remain. A platform like Water Watcher can help **democratize data** by making it accessible to non-specialists and by recognizing multiple knowledge systems. For instance, tribal nations might have extensive qualitative knowledge of water (generations of observing streamflow patterns or plant indicators) which isn’t captured in agency databases. While Water Watcher is primarily a data explorer, it could incorporate narrative or qualitative entries (perhaps via case studies or anecdotal sidebars) contributed by Indigenous elders or local stewards, thereby *broadening the definition of “data.”* On the flip side, an overly technical tool can exclude those without expertise or reliable internet. Thus, participatory design is critical: involving representatives from Indigenous communities, local stakeholders, and disability access experts in the design process will ensure the tool’s accessibility. Even choices like color schemes need consideration (color-blind friendly palettes, etc.). Language can exclude as well – providing Spanish translations (given the region’s large Spanish-speaking population in NM/AZ) or even Navajo language for key terms could increase reach. In terms of empowerment, the goal is that a school teacher on the Navajo Nation, a farmer in rural Utah, or a kayaker in Colorado can all *feel ownership* of the information – that it’s not solely the domain of PhDs or agency chiefs. When data is presented transparently and invitingly, it changes the dynamic: more people can participate in water discussions, attend public meetings armed with facts, or engage in collaborative problem-solving, rather than being passive recipients of expert knowledge.

* **Data Sovereignty and Control:** A subtle but important dimension is *whose data is it* and *who controls its use*. This is especially pertinent for tribes. Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles assert that Indigenous peoples should govern data about their lands and resources[academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/72/8/714/6610022#:~:text=Data%20Sovereignty%20in%20Community,their%20communities%20and%20lands)[lib.sfu.ca](https://www.lib.sfu.ca/help/publish/research-data-management/indigenous-data-sovereignty#:~:text=Indigenous%20data%20sovereignty%20,manage%2C%20and%20collectively%20own%20data). Water Watcher will need to navigate this carefully: it should incorporate tribal data **with permission and attribution**, and possibly allow tribes the option to display certain data at an aggregate level if fine detail is sensitive. For example, a tribe might be willing to show that “overall, 75% of our sampled sites meet standards” but not want every individual sample made public due to concerns about misuse or political implications. Engaging in consultation and perhaps providing tribal user accounts or controls could address this. In terms of policy, Water Watcher could encourage **co-stewardship** of data, where tribes and agencies share information on equal terms. Demonstrating respect for data sovereignty will build trust and could lead to more data sharing in the long run, filling gaps in the broader understanding of regional water health. It’s a balance: not using tribal data at all would exclude tribal waters from the picture (a form of erasure), but using it without consent would be extractive. Therefore, a participatory framework – maybe an advisory group with tribal water professionals – is a way to ensure the platform empowers rather than exploits Indigenous partners.

* **Ecological Justice and the More-Than-Human Perspective:** Freshwater health isn’t just about human use; it’s about ecosystems and the species that depend on water. A justice lens can extend to ecological justice – recognizing, for example, the rights of a river to flow or the intrinsic value of native fish. While that may be philosophical, it has practical data angles: Water Watcher could emphasize metrics relevant to ecological integrity (like streamflow deviation from natural patterns, connectivity for fish migration, the presence of invasive species). It can highlight areas where ecological health is poor even if human-centric criteria are met (e.g. a stream might meet human recreation standards but still be ecologically degraded). This ensures that the **non-human stakeholders** – wildlife, riparian habitats – are not forgotten in decision-making. Additionally, climate justice is a factor: climate change is altering water availability on the Plateau (smaller snowpacks, warmer streams[nps.gov](https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/ncpn-water-quality-report-2019-2022.htm#:~:text=,expected%20to%20continue%20to%20rise)), which can exacerbate inequities. Communities with fewer resources will struggle more with water scarcity or quality issues in a changing climate. By integrating climate data or future projections (where available) with current conditions, Water Watcher can highlight looming justice issues (for instance, which water sources serving vulnerable communities are most at risk of drying or pollution under climate scenarios). This forward-looking approach can prompt proactive measures, which is a form of intergenerational justice – protecting future generations’ water heritage.

* **Public Participation and Collaborative Governance:** Finally, the participatory dimension also involves **governance**: how decisions about water are made and how data informs them. On the Colorado Plateau, water governance is complex (multiple states, federal agencies, and tribes all intersect). A tool that is widely used by different stakeholders can serve as a **common ground** of facts, supporting more collaborative discussions. For example, if a state regulator, a tribal leader, and a community activist are all looking at the same Water Watcher data showing a certain river’s trend, that shared reference can facilitate dialogue. Furthermore, Water Watcher could be used in public engagement processes – imagine interactive public meetings where community members explore the map live and voice concerns or ideas (this is far more engaging than being handed a dense report). This kind of participatory mapping can surface local knowledge and priorities that might not emerge otherwise. It effectively brings more people into the **decision-making process**, addressing the classic problem of environmental governance: the gap between experts and the public. In doing so, it empowers historically excluded voices (like tribes or local communities) to influence policy with evidence. The platform can also track progress in a transparent way – for instance, if a river improves after a restoration project, everyone can see the data reflecting that, building trust that collective action yields results.

In conclusion, weaving justice, ecological, and participatory considerations into Water Watcher will make it more than just a technical tool – it becomes a vehicle for **inclusion and empowerment**. By revealing who and what might otherwise be invisible (be it a remote creek, a marginalized community, or an aquatic species), Water Watcher can ensure that freshwater health on the Colorado Plateau is understood in its full human and environmental context. This grounding in real-world needs and values will make the platform not only useful, but truly impactful for sustainable and equitable water stewardship.
