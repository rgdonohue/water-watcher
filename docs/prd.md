# üõ†Ô∏è Project PRD: Water Watcher ‚Äî Interactive Freshwater Health Explorer

## Summary
A lightweight, web-based map app that visualizes freshwater health indicators across the Colorado Plateau (CO, NM, AZ, UT). Pulls open datasets like EPA Water Quality, USGS Streamflow, and overlays drought indicators dynamically. Users can click a watershed or stream gauge to see health metrics, trends, and historical comparison charts.

---

## Problem Statement
Environmental and water resource managers ‚Äî and everyday citizens ‚Äî often struggle to easily access and understand the health of nearby water bodies. Most tools are clunky, government-sourced, or deeply technical. We need an accessible, beautiful, interactive tool to democratize water health awareness.

---

## Target Audience
- Environmental planners
- Outdoor recreationists
- Concerned citizens
- Portfolio reviewers and hiring managers

---

## Features (MVP Scope)
- Interactive map (Leaflet.js, MapLibre, or OpenLayers) showing:
  - Watersheds / stream gauges
  - Real-time or recent water quality metrics (e.g., pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrates)
  - Streamflow (USGS)
  - Drought severity overlays (NOAA)
- On-click popups with:
  - Current water quality rating (good/moderate/poor)
  - Latest streamflow
  - 7-day historical trends (small embedded chart)
- Simple layer toggles:
  - Water quality
  - Drought severity
  - Streamflow velocity
- Basic search (by watershed, river, or city; supports fuzzy matching)
- Mobile responsive design
- Accessibility: color contrast, keyboard navigation

---

## Nice-to-Haves (Stretch Goals)
- Animating trends over time (time slider)
- Story popups ("This river is critical habitat for ___")
- "Report a Concern" form (fake/demo)

---

## Data Sources
- USGS National Water Dashboard API (streamflow, water quality)
- EPA Water Quality Portal (DO, pH, nitrates, etc.)
- NOAA Drought Monitor Shapefiles
- Public watershed shapefiles (USGS HUC boundaries)

## üß™ Testing & Test-Driven Development

### Philosophy
- Adopt TDD for core features: Write tests before implementing new functionality to ensure reliability and guide development.

### Testing Stack
- **Frontend:** Jest, React Testing Library
- **Backend (if used):** pytest, httpx, FastAPI TestClient
- **E2E/Integration:** Cypress or Playwright
- **Linting/Static:** ESLint, Prettier, mypy (if Python)

## Timeline
| Day         | Tasks |
|-------------|-------|
| Day 1‚Äì2 | Project setup, base map rendering, initial dataset download |
| Day 3 | Build click popups + simple charts |
| Day 4 | Add layer toggles + simple search |
| Day 5 | Polish frontend: mobile responsiveness, design tweaks |
| Day 6 | Write project description, set up live demo, record 2-min walkthrough video |
| Day 7 | Push portfolio update, soft launch on LinkedIn/github/blog |
